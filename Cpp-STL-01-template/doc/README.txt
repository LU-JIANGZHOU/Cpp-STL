Before practice STL, we need to understand template.
Templates are powerful features of C++ which allows you to write generic programs. 
In simple terms, you can create a single function or a class to work with different 
data types using templates.
 STL is based on template
 The concept of templates can be used in three different ways:
1) Function Templates
2) Class Templates
3) Variadic function templates
